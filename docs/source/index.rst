Welcome to the Accessive documentation!
===================================

**Accessive** is a project designed to facilitate translation between the numerous formats of 
gene, transcript, and protein identifiers in common use in bioinformatics applications. 
Accessive is completely open-source and free to use and comes in three forms:

   - An interactive web application
   - A `REST API <https://alexander.bio/accessive/api_doc.html>`
   - A Python library (namely, this one)

The Accessive database currently supports a small set of species judged to be of particular 
interest to the research community. The Accessive database is constructed using identifier 
mapping information from `Ensembl <ensembl.org>`, `Uniprot <uniprot.org>`, and `Nextprot <nextprot.org>`.
